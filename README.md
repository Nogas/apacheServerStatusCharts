## Usage
Copy Status.html to your server and run in a browser. The application automatically reads the data from /server-status.

Prerequisites
- Turn on the mod_status Apache (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_status.html)
- Make sure the computer you want to view the data has access to /server-status

It is advisable to run the Status.html locally on the server to be monitored to avoid cross-domain problems (and prevent unwanted peeping).
